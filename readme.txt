This is the React JS source files for a simple application that can be launched to test pulling data from a RESTful api.  This works in conjunction with StudentCourseResults-v2 repository.  Download, build, and run that.

Then, download this source.  You can create a new React project with:
  npx create-react-app student-course-results-app
  
Replace the src directory files contents with the ones found in here.  You can save and run it, and if you have the StudentCourseResults service running as well, you should see a table of students (superheroes in this case!), the courses they took, and their grades.
